## How to Play

It's a hot day and your character is looking for a nice dip in the river. First, select a difficulty level. The goal of the game is to guide your player character from the bottom of the screen to the top of the screen, where the water is. 

Enemies will be blocking you way as you try to cross. Be careful and avoid getting hit, otherwise you'll lose your life and have to start over! Watch out for different enemy types--each has different characteristics.

Different pickups will be randomly placed on tiles. Every pickup increases your score by a varying amount and some will have additional effects as well.

Try to get a high score, then try to beat it on your next playthrough! Good luck!
